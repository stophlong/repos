USAGE NOTES:
From Takaishi's web-site:
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/r_takaishi/?of=15

You need to look up the unique user ID in toodledo's account settings and put this in your .emacs

(Require 'org-toodledo)
(setq org-toodledo-unique-uid "This unique user ID")
(setq org-toodledo-password "password ")
(setq org-toodledo-files' (" / here / file / path. org "))

The following data can be synchronized as of 2010_05_11
Title
Tag
Start date
Period
Priority (only for stage 3. toodledo org-mode in three cases in the A, C -1 is now)

Exposed commands:
org-toodledo-pull to pull from toodledo
org-toodledo-push to push to toodledo

The required "sexpath.el" is now available 
from http://cx4a.sakura.ne.jp/blog/2009/01/s-xpath-elisp.html
and on github.
See http://www.cx4a.org/ for author's page

MAJOR ISSUES:
THIS IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY YET AND CAN EASILY DELETE ALL YOUR ORG-TOODLEDO-PUSH ENTRIES! BACKUP BEFORE USE.
